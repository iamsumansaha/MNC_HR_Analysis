### üßπ Data Preparation

Created a **clean view** `cl_hr_data` with refined location and standardized date formatting.

```sql
CREATE VIEW cl_hr_data AS (
    SELECT
        employee_id,
        full_name,
        department,
        job_title,
        STR_TO_DATE(hire_date, '%d-%m-%Y') AS date_of_hire,
        LEFT(location, LOCATE(',', location) - 1) AS City,
        RIGHT(location, LENGTH(location) - LOCATE(',', location)) AS Country,
        performance_rating,
        experience_years,
        status,
        work_mode,
        salary_inr
    FROM hr_data
);
```
